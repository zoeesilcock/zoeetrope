      about_me1: "If you find yourself here you are most likely looking to find out who I am. My name is Zoee Silcock but my friends call me Zilly-Z /zÉªli: zi:/ sometimes, I guess that would be my rapper name if I ever get tired of coding. On a more serious note I hope to give you a picture of me by showcasing projects I have worked on in my spare time."
      about_me2: "I am passionate about web development and this ends up being a bit of a playground for me. Here I can test new technologies that I am interested in without the limits usually imposed by having a more strictly defined purpose with the website. This site is open source so you can follow the, somewhat sporadic, development on github."
