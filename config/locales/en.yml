      lead: "This is my little corner of this wonderous thing that we call the internet. I am a programmer living in Stockholm Sweden. I have worked as a full stack web developer for several years but now I focus on game development."
      about_me1: "If you find yourself here you are most likely looking to find out who I am. My name is Zoee Silcock but my friends call me Zilly-Z /zÉªli: zi:/ sometimes, I guess that would be my rapper name if I ever get tired of coding. Or if I decided to be an MMA fighter I guess I would be called Zoee \"The Cock\" Silcock."
      about_me2: "I've been into programming and video games since I was a kid. After several years working with web development I started making games in my spare time. I started out by learning Cocos2D but after a while I switched over to Unity. This lead to me co-founding a game development company called <a href='http://rocketpants.se' target='_blank'>Rocket Pants</a> with a good friend."
      about_me3: "I am still interested in web development and I do have use for those skills in my new venture. I built the company website for example. This site also happens to be open source so you can follow the, albeit sporadic, development on github."
